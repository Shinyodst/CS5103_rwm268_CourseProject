How to run file:

1.Nothing needs to be modified, just run the code

2.If the user wants to test the functions, the functions can either be called, or the given variables can be modified to other values

3.There is a total of 3 functions that take long variables:

addDigits(long val1,long val2)	//function 1

subDigits(long val1, long val2)	//function 2

digitToString(long val)			//function 3


Function 1 adds two longs together, in the order of val2 being added to val1 and returns sum		sum = val1 + val2

Function 2 subtracts two longs from each other, in the order of val2 being subtracted from val1, and returns remainder		sum = val1 - val2

Function3 converts a long into a string, and returns the formatted string with commas correctly placed
