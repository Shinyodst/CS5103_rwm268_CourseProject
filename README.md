In this project there is computation on big numbers (thousands of digits).

Requirements:

1.Addition of two numbers

2.Subtraction of two numbers

3.Computation on big numbers

4.Account for a negative array size and return error

5.Account for non-integers and return error

Unit Tests:

1.(Line 90) Tests addition function of two arrays

2.(Line 91) Tests subtraction function of two arrays

3.(Line 93) Tests addition function of two arrays

4.(Line 94) Tests subtraction function of two arrays

5.(Line 22 and 43) Tests to make sure the array size is 0 or greater, requests to retry if an error occurs

6.(Line 63 and 79) Tests to make sure all inputs are of type int, requests to retry if an error occurs

How to run file:

1.Nothing needs to be modified, just run the code

2.After running the code, it will ask for the size of the first array, then the second

3.Once the size of the arrays have been verified, you can start filling in the arrays accordingly

4.If both arrays have been assigned correctly, the functions will run in the order of:

addSet(array 1, array 2) array 1 + array 2
subSet(array 1, array 2) array 1 - array 2
addSet(array 2, array 1) array 2 + array 1
subSet(array 2, array 1) array 2 - array 1
