How to run file:

1.Nothing needs to be modified, just run the code

2.If the user wants to test the functions, the functions can either be called, or the given variables can be modified to other values

3.There is a total of 3 functions that take long variables, and 4 functions that take strings as parameters:

addDigits(long val1,long val2)	//function 1

subDigits(long val1, long val2)	//function 2

digitToString(long val)			//function 3

addDecimalPosition(string s, int i) //function 4

addStrings(string s1, string s2)	//function 5

subStrings(string s1, string s2)	//function 6

compareStrings(string s1, string s2) //function 7


Function 1 adds two longs together, in the order of val2 being added to val1 and returns sum		sum = val1 + val2

Function 2 subtracts two longs from each other, in the order of val2 being subtracted from val1, and returns remainder		sum = val1 - val2

Function 3 converts a long into a string, and returns the formatted string with commas correctly placed

Function 4 takes a string and an integer, where the integer is reference to where in the "array" of numbers the decimal spot should be, and returns a 		string with the updated decimal point

Function 5 converts two strings into floats in order to do addition, and then returns the sum as a string

Function 6 converts two strings into floats in order to do subtraction, and then returns the difference as a string

Function 7 compares two strings and checks if both strings are equivalent to each other, having a decimal point matters in this function
